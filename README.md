# Mushi ü´ñüçµ

_WebSocketStream with mutual authentication._

## What is this?

**[Iroh](https://iroh.computer)** is peer-to-peer QUIC connections with peer-to-peer authentication
based on ED25519 keys. **Mushi** is client-server QUIC connections with peer-to-peer authentication
based on X.509 keys.

If you're not familiar, Iroh is this really neat project that offers the same kind of
"it just works" networking as [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), but embedded directly into
applications, like you'd have TCP or HTTP. Iroh performs all the NAT traversal, hole-punching, port
negotiation, discovery of peers, etc... and you get a super-simple `Endpoint` structure that you
can talk to other peers with. The cryptography of Iroh is based on mTLS: each peer has an ED25519
keypair, and uses it both as a certificate and as a node identity. There's no PKI: an incoming
connection presents its ED25519 public key, the TLS handshake makes sure it's authentic, and it's
up to the application whether it trusts that key (and establishes the connection) or not.

Mushi came about when wanting something similar to Iroh, but in a context where the peer-to-peer
bits were unnecessary (and in fact counter-productive), and where web PKI was inappropriate, yet
an application-defined trust model with mutually-authenticated peers was more desirable.
Additionally, with discovery and other details unused, it became easier to be flexible on the
cryptography suite: Mushi works with anything that TLS 1.3 does, such as ECDSA, rather than being
restricted to ED25519.

In the end, Mushi is:

- ~cheap bidi links
- over QUIC (with fallback to TCP)
- with short-lived self-signed certificates on both client and server sides
- from persistent (long-lived) keypairs

On connection establishment, an Endpoint receives the DER-encoded Public Key Information block of
the other side, and can use that as an opaque identity blob for the remote peer. That structure
contains both the public key data and an algorithm specifier, which lets applications choose from
ECDSA or ED25519 as is more convenient. (RSA is not allowed.)

Mushi exposes a simpler API than WebTransport, Iroh, or QUIC: `Link`, which is a bidi connection
between two peers. Links transparently handle multiplexing over QUIC, keepalives, reconnections
where possible, and fall back to TCP if QUIC isn't available. At establishment, both sides approve
the remote's public key, and the server chooses a subprotocol from the set proposed by the client.

## How do I use this?

Mushi is [a Rust crate][lib-rust] ([docs][docs-rust]), with some foreign interfaces for
convenience:

- [Node.js][lib-node] ([docs][docs-node])
- [Python][lib-python] ([docs][docs-python]) (experimental!)
- [a CLI tool][cli] ([docs][docs-cli]) (TODO!)
